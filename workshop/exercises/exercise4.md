# Exercise 4: Local Development Shared Publicly

## Install ngrok

Set up ngrok on your local platform

## Try the app from another device

Swap URLs with the person next to you or try accessing the project from your phone. Edit the application code and observe the changes on the other device.

## Retry requests

Take a look at the ngrok dashboard and replay a request, look at the response. Edit the application code so the output will be different, and replay again. Repeat this as much as you like!
