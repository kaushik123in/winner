You will need:

* any HTTP client: your browser, Postman, curl or something else (or all of these!)
* a PHP installation (can be Heroku or similar)

## Set up Sample App

Clone the repo at https://github.com/lornajane/fun-with-http and get the app running (instructions in the `README`).

## Use HTTP Clients

Try different clients and hit the root URL to get a "Hello World" response.
