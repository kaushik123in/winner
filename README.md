# Fun with HTTP

This is the companion repository to my "Web Developers' HTTP Toolbox" workshop session at PHP UK 2019. The materials are not intended to stand alone and are likely to be useful only to those in the workshop.

## Materials

Find the slide deck and exercises in the `workshop/` folder.

## Set up the sample application

This is a SlimPHP application. To set it up:

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Run `composer install` in the root directory
* To run locally: change to the `public/` directory and run `php -S localhost:8080`. Alternatively, there is a `Procfile` for use with Heroku if you are familiar with that platform.
